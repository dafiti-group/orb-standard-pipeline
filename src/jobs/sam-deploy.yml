      Available options inside orb is [node, golang]
      To use those executors from this orb, use the sintaxe :
      ```yaml
        version: 2.1
        ...
        executors:
          my-executor:
            docker:
              - image: my-image:lts
        workflows:
          deployment-flow:
            jobs:
              ...
              - dft/sam-test:
                  name: unit-test
                  runner: dft/node
              - dft/sam-test:
                  name: unit-test
                  runner: dft/golang
              # using outside orb executor
              - dft/sam-test:
                  name: unit-test
                  runner: my-executor
      ```
